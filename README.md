### Core loops
- They loop through different rooms and floors of the dungeon, gathering loot from them and after dying or reaching the last level, they will comeback to the main lobby where they will gain rewards based on the levels and objectives completed.
The player then can spend those rewards in the shop for better items and effects.
- It encourages the player to start more rounds, rather than making the player try their hardest to pass higher levels, by pure skill.
- The player is expected to die quite fast in the beginning, but be able to survive more and more while advancing through the game.

### Objectives and Progression
- The player and their dog will first be  taught how the dungeon works, that everytime they die, they will be respawn with all their loot and equipment lost during their time in the dungeon, and only the permanent points will be left, helping the player purchase better effects and items that can be found in the dungeon, or improving their own character (f.x health points, armor, etc.).
- Short term goals are completing the dungeon floors
- Long term goals are mastering their character, figthing the final boss and rescuing Ricardo's princess.

### Game Systems
#### Player interactable
- Character upgrade system
- Item unlocking system

#### Player cannot interact
- Random level generation
- Random loot drop
- AI(more or less) enemies

### Interactivity
<p>
The player will be constantly pressed to continue moving on through the dungeon. The game is supposed to create feelings of adrenaline and 
unpredictability, constantly making the player try to reach further and further through the levels by collecting loot and better weapons on the way.

The combat will be either melee, ranged or terrain kills. The player will be able to move around the levels from the side perspective and use everything in their power to survive.
